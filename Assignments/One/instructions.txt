Cho-Han Bakuchi Simulation
Cho Han Bakuchi is a very simple betting game using two standard dice (read the link).
Probably this short video script explains what it means. In this assignment, you will be playing with two other betters,
player 1 and 2. The three of you, having the same starting allowance of $100, must bet (cannot pass the round) up to their maximum allowances.
By winning, the same amount will be given by the house dealer.

A slight intelligence you need to implement is: if the allowance of player 1 or 2, say player 1's,
becomes less than yours, the betting of player 1will become up to the half of player 1's allowance so that player 1 can take an defensive position.
When player 1 gains more than you, player 1's betting goes up to the maximum allowance again. Note that this rule applies to player 2 too.

The game will end if you become broke or other two players become broke. See a sample session below:

               You have $100
                Player1 has $100
                Player2 has $100

                Enter "c" (even) or "h" (odd) and an amount you bet: c 100
                You bet $100 -> won...
                Player1 bet $9 -> won...
                Player2 bet $31 -> won...

                   You have $200
                Player1 has $109
                Player2 has $131

                Enter "c" (even) or "h" (odd) and an amount you bet: h 50
                You bet $50 -> won...
                Player1 bet $54 -> won...
                Player2 bet $10 -> won...

                   You have $250
                Player1 has $163
                Player2 has $141

                Enter "c" (even) or "h" (odd) and an amount you bet: c 120
                You bet $120 -> lost...
                Player1 bet $63 -> won...
                Player2 bet $8 -> lost...

                   You have $130
                Player1 has $226
                Player2 has $133

                Enter "c" (even) or "h" (odd) and an amount you bet: h 130
                You bet $130 -> lost...
                You are broke...
                Bye...

The final requirement is that you must complete your coding as short as possible. Try shortest coding (my solution < 70 lines).
Your submission does not require rigorous input error checking (which is not easily done with your current C++ knowledge).
Extra credit will be considered for this work however. If you feel tired of programming and need a rest,
see this classic movie which contains interesting  Bakuchi scenes...
